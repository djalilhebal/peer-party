# Automated testing

(WIP)

Something like [playwright-test-2023-10-25.js](https://gist.github.com/djalilhebal/bf0beabb6433cf132231729ad8166745)

Was considering literal programming or some approach similar to BDD frameworks (like Cucumber).
I have never use these two before, but they seem interesting.

Decided to use simpler and more familiar things:
- Playwright (I used Puppeteer before)
- Tape.

And instead of writing a scenario then implementing it, I can "narrate" the code itself.

Kinda similar to "ReplayRecounter" but actually useful.
(Why does everyhing have to alliterate? Beats me.)


## Lit programming

- ObservableHQ.com
- [ ] CHECK https://github.com/hackbg/ganesha
    * Mentioned on Wikipedia.
- [ ] CHECK https://github.com/matjp/jweb
    * Mentioned on Wikipedia.


## Interesting

- [ ] BDD vs E2E testing?

- [ ] READ: https://www.browserstack.com/guide/best-test-automation-frameworks

- Playwright https://playwright.dev
    * Has Java version as well!

- JBehave https://jbehave.org
    * KAITO: looks super cool.

- Gauge https://gauge.org
    * Uses markdown to author test cases and scenarios.
    Seems similar to JBehave.

- Mocha https://mochajs.org
    * Seems simple enough.
