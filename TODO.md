# TODO

## UI/UX

- [ ] Drag and drop files (video and subtitles).

- [ ] Support subtitles.

- [ ] Perf: Use Preact instead of React.

- [ ] Fault tolerance (e.g. auto-reconnecting)

- [ ] Optimistic updates (e.g. Viewer sends a message to Owner. Viewer should see it instantly.)


## Docs

- [~] Sketch our arch using Excalidraw.


## Test

- [ ] Use Tape or Mocha's `test()` with Playwright's `expect()`

- [ ] Rename `GenericAgent` to `ParticipantAgent`

- [ ] Expect the URL to contain the key (TBD the actual pattern)
    * `djalil.me/peer-party?code={roomCode}`
    * `peerparty.djalil.me/{roomCode}`
